# Data Science: Foundations in R, Final Assignment

### This assignment is the last project of my Coursera.com program, offered by Johns Hopkins University and their informative, interactive, and exciting course. This experience has made a huge impact on how I approach my work in science/academia, and I am so grateful for this opportunity to see some of the wonders of data science. Thank you for reading my work!!
